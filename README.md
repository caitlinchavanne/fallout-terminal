Internet Tech II Project 2 - [HTML/SASS/JS&amp;jQuery]

Requirements for assigned project were met and submitted; but this is still a work in progress!
I intent to make it act as closely as possible to the terminal in Fallout 4.
I also intend to add and clean internal documentation within the code, so everyone is clear wht I'm doing.
Any ideas or questions welcomed.
